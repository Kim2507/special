              You are turning 19! Wow I have been being your older sister for 19 years.
              Thank you for everything you have done for me<br>
              You have been by my side when I was old but not mature enough, you don't hate me when I bullied you a lot in the past (don't you dare), I am sorry I was not a best mature sister at the time.<br>
              You have been by my side when I was down<br>
              You have been by my side to make me laugh and angry at the same time.<br>
              I will never forget time we have spent together especially tough time.<br>
              I hate that I am older than you a lot that makes a gap where I already forgot how to do the math where u were learning it! I hate that I am not a super intelligent and was not able to help you sometimes!<br>
              But I love you, you will always be my little sister, I will continue eating your snack and tease you! That is fun!<br>
              Anyway, I am so proud of you!<br>
              I wish you the best in your journey! Got into the internship/job you want<br>
              I wish that you can acchive whatever you want!<br>
              But I also hope you can start eating vegie because vegie is very important to your body, also exercie when you are free!<br>
